### About me:
My first contact with programming was when I was 14, exploring the world of **online gaming**. I was very interested to start creating my own private servers to play with my friends and I ended up developing the websites for those projects and that's how I've got here today.

I've been using VueJS as my main framework since december/2017. I’ve built big and small applications with it, from landing pages for big companies, to an entire recursively automated workflow system, with drag and drop support using no library that was a key feature responsible for a $30M funding.

I’ve been working for remote companies in Europe and USA since 2020 and leading frontend development for almost 1 year. I’m passionate about learning new things and making modern and clean interfaces.
