### About me:
My first contact with programming was when I was 14, exploring the world of **online gaming**. I was very interested to start creating my own private servers to play with my friends and I ended up developing the websites for those projects and that's how I've got here today.

I love to explore new possibilities and create new perspectives to see simple things. Besides I am a framework agnostic, I've been using **VueJS** as my main javascript framework since Dec/2018. It’s suitable for basically any kind of application and it's reliability is amazing.

I’ve built big and small applications with Vue, from landing pages to an entire car financing system for one of the biggest banks in Brazil, to a BI tool for an Estonian startup. I’m passionate about **learning new things** and making **modern** and **intuitive interfaces**.
